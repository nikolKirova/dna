            "text": "<p>During her second year of her Master in Advanced Architecture, Nikol Kirova was selected among students from all over the world as one of the 10 scholars to be part of the Norman Foster Foundation Robotics Atelier. The second edition of the robotics atelier took place in November (2018) in Madrid, under the mentorship of Fabio Gramazio, Co-Founder Gramazio Kohler Research. The goal was investigating new ways of reflecting on the physics of architecture, its design and materialization. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Robotics Atelier gathered scholars and professionals to reflect on technological integration and digital fabrication in architecture. Scholars were divided into three groups and assigned a different tool and material to work with. During the workshop, they created highly informed architectural artefacts, reusable and re-configurable with high geometrical flexibility and no material waste.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>During an intense week of workshops and lectures, Nikol Kirova and her groupmates developed a robotic fabrication workflow for reusable earth formwork aimed at plaster and concrete casting with no material waste. Under the guidance of the Kohler Research team multiple prototypes were developed to demonstrate and test the proposed robotic fabrication method. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outcome of the workshop was above all the descriptive and innovative workflow that pushes the boundaries of traditional construction and proposes new ways of designing and building. Nikol is currently an official member of the Norman Foster Foundation Alumni Group that places her among a small circle of change makers and innovative multidisciplinary architects that will set the future of the field.<\/p>"
